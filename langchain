A comprehensive guide of resources to build  LangChain + LLM 

 ðŸ”— What is LangChain? 
LangChain is a powerful framework to build applications with LLMs. It enhances the capabilities of LLMs by providing a standard interface for prompt templates and integration of language models with different APIs and external databases. It can be used to build a chatbot, a Q&A answering platform, and any intelligent applications that can understand natural language and respond to user requests in real-time.
